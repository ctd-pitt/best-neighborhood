    "I'm Using Pittsburgh Arrest Data from 2023. I'm measuring the number of each arrest by neighborhood. I also used census population data from 2020 (I couldn't find more recent) I'n order to get a true crime rate. \n",

    "The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",

    "Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this."
